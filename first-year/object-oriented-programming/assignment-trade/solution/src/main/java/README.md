<h3>Execution</h3>
<br>
Unfortunately, I was unable to create the "run.sh" 
due to the fact that I have a dependency in my pom.xml file, so when running the Main class, 
it can't see the dependency. 
<br>
<br>
The "Main" class runs perfectly in the IDE (IntellijIdea). Input and output files can be specified in the main method of
the "Main" class. 

<h3>Translation</h3>
"Handler" class in "JsonPackage" is responsible for translating the input in inFile from Polish to English.
It may be that I have missed some of the possible arguments, but it works smoothly with the test file presented in
the description of the task.
