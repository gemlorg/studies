FLAGS:

(1) FLAG{ToJestFlagaZeStopki}

(2) FLAG{JeszczeJednaFlagaZaPunkty}

(3) FLAG{71a4b4fd2214b808e4942dfb06c717878399a04c} //processed from image automatically, not sure if correct. orig: (./flag3.png)

SOLUTION:

To get the (1) flag we have to open the source code and notice that an admin user is checking their mailbox and reading every mail sent.
We also need to realize that when a user recieves and opens a card, it's contents are being rendered as html code. Next we simply need to 
send a card that forces the admin to send a card back to us, which is a similar task to what has been done on the ex classes. 
(scripts doing just that are supposed to be attached to the solution, of course)

To get the (2) flag, we need to look through the souce code, and see that when a card is being rendered, 
it's template is souced from a file under {os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))}/card_templates/{card.template}. 
Since card.template can be controlled by the sender of the card and it doesn't seem to be checked anywhere, it would be 
sufficient to send a card to ourselves with a template value "../ x 10 flag.txt" 

Getting the (3) flag, was the hardest part of the assignment for me. By looking at the source files, it's easy to see that
the server internally accepts http connections on /...-super-secret-microservice. Without much thought, it might seem a good idea to 
try to force the admin user to view the page and send it's contents elsewhere. However (after some hours of trying), it turns out to be 
either very very hard, or simply impossible(I'm not qualified enough to claim that). The problem is that the admin is viewing their cards 
with https and we can't make a http get request due to SOP. Redirecting the admin to http://web.kazet.cc:42448/show/... also won't work 
since the server only accepts. After trying countless times and almost losing the hope of solving the assignment we will try to find another 
way and look into the source code once again. To our surprise, the download-png view opens localhost with http which is perhaps exactly what we need. 
Now we just need to send a card to ourselves that changes window.location.href to ...-super-secret-microservice/index.html, and then open the card in
download-png view. The server will politely open the file and provide us with a screenshot of it's contents.
