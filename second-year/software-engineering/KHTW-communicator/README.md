When cloning repository, need to do "npm install" to install needed packages (node_modules/ is in .gitignore since it's quite large).
To start app run in src/ command: "npx expo start"

You might need to run:

"npm install expo"

"npm install --save react-native-gifted-chat"

"npm install react-native-mathjax"

"npm install react-native-webview"
