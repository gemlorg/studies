# Assignment Instructions

Your task is to break the application's security, using the knowledge gained during the classes, and find the flags.

For each flag found, you can receive up to 3 â…“ points, for a total of 10 points.

If the assignment is submitted late, 1 point will be deducted for each started day of delay.

Even if you did not manage to find the flag, send your solution - partial solutions can also earn points.

Your solution should include:

- The content of the flags (as proof of task completion).
- A description of the identified vulnerabilities and how they were exploited. The description should be detailed enough for us to understand how you reached the solution.
- The source code of all used payloads/scripts - include them as separate files (not as code blocks within a PDF file) to make it easier for us to test them.

To write a program that makes HTTP requests, we recommend using the `requests` library in Python.

Good luck!

All solutions that obtain the correct flag will be scored equally, regardless of whether the exploit could have been written more simply or elegantly. Scripts and descriptions will be evaluated solely based on your understanding of the task.
